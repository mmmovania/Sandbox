# Sandbox
A set of demo screen captures from some of my leapmotion, webgl demos.

# Examples
# Browser based Volume Rendering
This demo shows how to do GPU based volume rendering in WebGL. The tech stack used includes Three.js, WebGL. and javascript. No third party volume rendering library was used for this.

# LeapMotion interaction with Cloth
This demo shows real-time interaction of LeapMotion controller with a cloth piece. The tech stack used is OpenGL, C++ and the LeapMotion sdk. For cloth simulation, I used my own open source library (OpenCloth).
